- Background color: A desaturated gold, HSL(48, 20%, 96%), or #F9F7F1 in hex, to create a serene backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: A warm, inviting analogous tone achieved via HSL(18, 80%, 50%), or #E66914, to guide focus and add warmth.
- Body: 'Literata' serif for readability; Headlines: 'Playfair' serif for elegance.
- Use clear, symbolic icons. Focus on traditional religious symbols adapted to a modern minimalist style.
- Prioritize clear hierarchy and scannability with well-defined sections.
- Subtle transitions for menu navigation. A fade-in effect when content loads can provide a smooth user experience.
